This operation, when activated, allows you to select the edges of a custom polygon by clicking on the map. \nWhen you are satisfied with your polygon, click on the initial edge to finish and it will be automatically added to the layers. \n Task: Find Nidaros Cathedral, select \"Draw Polygon\" and create a circumscribing polygon like the picture.

    "detailed": "After you have finished adding the circumscribing polygon, you will notice that the polygon has shown up as a layer in the layers tab in the control panel. \n Layers are assigned a random name, with the operation used as a prefix for easier identification. \n Each layer has three buttons, these buttons are used to control visibility, change name of the layer or delete layer. \nTask: Toggle the visibility by pressing the eye-button, you should see that the polygon dissapears. Press it again to make the polygon visible again."

This is perfect when used on our buffers, as it will return the area we want to live in. \nTask: Select nidaros_500 and nidaros_1000 and press symmetric difference. Name the layer nidaros_donut.

When a file is added, it is read, translated to layer data and added to the map. \n NOTE: This file upload only accepts geojson and json, and will give you a warning if you try to upload other file types. \n NOTE: It supports the upload of multiple files at the time."
